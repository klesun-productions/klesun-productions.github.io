<h2>Big Site Blacklist</h2>

<p>Don't you hate it when you search for a song, a book, or an anime, and google give you some lame sites in results that either do not 
    contain what you are looking for at all, either contain but in very handicaped state, like book being cut to first chapter 
    or split to pages, either require you to do some nasty things, like watching ads for minute to get what you want?</p>

<p>Rejoice, no more that!</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/klesun/shmidusic.lv/master/scripts/cjs/google.com.js">blacklist</a></p>

<p>To use it, install the
    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija?hl=en">cjs</a>
    plugin, or anything similar if you are not under chrome (like
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">greasemonkey</a> i suppose)</p>

<p>And add the "<code>https://cdn.rawgit.com/klesun/shmidusic.lv/master/scripts/cjs/google.com.js</code>" to "your own external scripts"
    in the plugin when you are on the <a href="https://www.google.com/">google</a> page</p>
