                    <!-- may be updated/rephrased -->
                    <li>There are three players, codenamed
                        <span data-owner="GREY"><span class="player-name-holder">GREY</span></span>,
                        <span data-owner="DARK"><span class="player-name-holder">DARK</span></span> and
                        <span data-owner="LIGHT"><span class="player-name-holder">LIGHT</span></span>,
                        each starts at one of the three tiles in the center of the board
                    </li>
                    <li>Every turn each player chooses one of up to three directions to move his triangular
                        representation or skips his turn by pressing Esc. If player is blocked from all
                        three ways and there is nowhere to go, turn is skipped automatically
                    </li>
                    <li>Stepping on any tile makes you it's owner, coloring it with your color, slowing down
                        enemies stepping on it and increasing your respective resource quantity if it yields one
                    </li>
                    <li>There are three kinds of resources randomly placed on some tiles:
                        <span data-resource="WHEAT">Wheat</span>,
                        <span data-resource="OIL">Oil</span> and
                        <span data-resource="GOLD">Gold</span>.
                        Owned resources form your total score by formula:
                        <span data-resource="WHEAT">Wheat</span> x
                        <span data-resource="OIL">Oil</span> x
                        <span data-resource="GOLD">Gold</span>.
                        Each player starts with 1 permanent unit of each resource.
                        Here is an example: if you captured
                        2 tiles of <span data-resource="WHEAT">Wheat</span> (3 units in total),
                        2 tiles of <span data-resource="OIL">Oil</span> (3 units in total) and
                        2 tiles of <span data-resource="GOLD">Gold</span> (3 units in total), your total score is
                        <code>3 x 3 x 3 = 27</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>When there are no more turns left, the player with the greatest total score becomes the winner</li>
                    <li>You can step on an enemy owned tile, this will make it belong to you, but you skip 2 turns after that as a penalty</li>
                    <li>You can not step on a tile on which another player is currently standing. You can neither
                        step on <i>Dead Space</i> randomly placed in place of some tiles on the board
                    </li>
                </ul>
