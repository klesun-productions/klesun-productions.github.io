## Abstract

This document is to be used as a reference for the interviewing Full Stack Developer position candidates to measure their knowledge/competence.

It should be made clear to the applicant that they are not expected to answer all of the questions, they should just try to answer as many questions they know answer to as possible, but it's ok if they don't have an answer for any of them.

## Introduction

- Can you tell us a bit about yourself?


## General programming questions (13 questions)

- What is the difference between data structures: Set and List?
  - Set does not store duplicate values and provides methods to check for presence of an element in constant time

- What is the difference between data structures: Queue and Stack?
  - Queue: first-in-first-out, Stack: last-in-first-out

- What is Binary Search?
  - ожидаемый ответ: "Из отсортированного массива берётся эелемент по середине и сравнивается с искомым значением: если элемент больше искомого, исключаем из поиска половину массива начиная со среднего элемента, иначе исключаем половину до середины. Из оставшейся половины снова берём элемент по середине и снова отсекаем половину, продолжаем до тех пор пока в ходе половинивания не останется 1 элемент - это и будет искомое значение. Логаритмическое время."

- What is Garbage Collector?
  - A mechanism that releases memory that was reserved for variables that are not referenced by the code anymore. It's contrary to manual memory allocation used in C and Rust where programmer has to allocate and release memory explicitly for every dynamic data structure like list. The advantage of garbage collection is simplicity of code and safety from memory leaks, the disadvantage is performance and stop-the-world events.

- Could you describe how memory is allocated in ArrayList data structure when you insert a new value?
  - A fixed size array with heuristic initial length is created underneath. When the length is reached, a new array is created with new length multiplied by a heuristic factor, like two, all values are then copied from old array to new array.

- Can you tell me what Modulus arithmetic operator does? (more of a academic termin knowledge question rather than a programming question)

- What is Hash Map (aka Map, aka Dictionary, aka Associative Array)
  - ожидаемый ответ: "мап предназначен для хранения и быстрого доступа к элементу по ключу (ключ как правило строка) за константное время"

- What is the difference between interpreted languages (javascript, php, lua, python) and compiled languages (c, c++, Go, Rust)
  - Interpreted languages are compiled in real time, so you execute the code directly. Compiled languages can't be executed directly, they have to be first compiled into a binary .exe file with architecture-specific machine instructions.

- What can you tell abount JIT: bytecode in Java or it's analog CIL/CLR in C#
  - JIT languages are compiled into an intermediary abstract machine language that is not specific to any architecture. They are similarto compiled languages in that they can't be executed directly from source code, and they are also similar to interpreted languages in that their bytecode is interpreted into binary on execution.

- Which of the following is better and why: exponential complexity O(2^N), constant compexity O(1), linear complexity O(N), quadratic complexity O(N^2), logarithmic complexity O(log(N))
  - constant > logarithmic > linear > quadratic > exponential. The complexity says how execution time of the program depends on the number of elements in the input. Constant and logarithmic are super fast, exponential is awfully slow.

- What is Decentralized Denial of Service attack?
  - Evil programmers sending a lot of dummy requests to the server of good programmers to overburen it and make it inoperable.


## Javascrpt questions (14 questions)

- What is WebSockets?
  - Expected answer: a protocol used in browsers that allows sending messages from server to client, contrary to http where requests can only be sent from client to server.

- What is the difference between http and https?
  - https uses ssl certificates to encrypt and sign requests and responses therefore protecting the contents of communication between server and client from ISPs

- How would you get the value of a specific URL query parameter from address bar?
  - Expected answer: using new URL(window.location.href).search or new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)

- How does javascript deal with memory allocated for variables after you are done using them?
  - It garbage collects them

- Can you describe the purpose of bundlers (webpack/esbuild/browserify/etc...)
  - Bundlers merge all javascript files in your project into a single file to reduce number of requests client has to make to fetch all of the application code. Bundlers also traditionally provide transformations to further optimize application's load speed, like minification of code, tree-shaking. Bundlers also usually allow you to use various language features that are unavailable to vanilla javascript, like jsx, typescript, esnext, etc...

- (if not included in preceding answer) Can you explain the principles of code minification and tree-shaking?
  - Code minification removes whitespace, shortens variable names and does some other syntaxical tricks to the js code to make it shorter and reduce the traffic. Tree-shaking is a process in a bundler that excludes files that are not effectively used in the bundled code, like if you are importing a specific function from lodash, bundler will only include that specific function in the bundle rather than the whole lodash library code.

- What is gzip/deflate/brottli?
  - Compression algorithms that are normally used for all text files transferred over network to reduce their size usually 10-20 times. The algorithms usually encode frequently repeating sequences of letters in the file with a smaller amount of bits, while rarely repeating sequences - with larget amount of bits.    

- What is innerHTML property in DOM elements? Would you use innerHTML to insert a text content in an html element and how?
  - Expected answer: either "I would rather use textContent" or "I would escape html entities first" because injection

- What is race condition?
  - Poorly designed behaviour of the application that relies on the certain order of multiple async calls without means taken to guarantee the execution order.  

- What are circular imports? Are they bad? Why?
  - Circular imports is a co-dependency situation where module A imports module B while module B imports module A which makes neither of the imports resolvable without hacks like assuming one of them being imported as `undefined` until the other module is done evaluating. This is very bad as errors caused by circular references (often resulting in error messages like "undefined is not a constructor") are very hard to detect especially if code is designed in a way that circular imports are very numerous and you can't just un-circle them all by a tool like madge.   

- Assuming you need to retrieve data from 3 different independent APIs urls using fetch. Each API takes around 3 seconds to execute. You need to get results from all 3 APIs as fast as possible. How would you do that? (How to execute multiple http requests in parallel rather than sequentially?)
  - Expected answer: using Promise.all() or calling first await after last request was started.

- What is regular expressions?
  - A language used to describe the pattern of a string to ensure that it matches a specific format and to extract particular parts of the string.

- What is the most common cause of "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error, also known as "Stack Overflow"
  - Infinite recursion

- What are advantages/disadvantages of using Map over plain object?
  - Plain objects were designed for class-like structures, not for arbitrary key-value pairs and historically have certain questionable behaviour like sorting of numerical keys. Map also let's you use any object as a key, whereas plain object keys are always casted to string (except for symbols).

- What is the Symbol data type
  - An instance of a symbol is a unique reference that is guaranteed to not be equal to any other value which allows, for example, to create a key in an object that is guaranteed not to clash with any other field with same string name.

- What is WebWorkers?
  - Expected answer: an API in browsers that allows you to utilize more than one CPU cores in your application for computation heavy operations, like data compression and video coding

- (this one will be tricky to explain) When you instantiate a Date class from a string in format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` (aka SQL datetime format), how will this string be interpreted? What will be the timezone offset of the resulting Date object?
  - It will interpret the string as a local time of user's browser. To interpret it as UTC, the string has to include Z or +0 suffix. Interpreting it as a timezone differing from UTC and from user's browser is not possible with native javascript Date class.   

- How would you implement a form with file upload? How would you transfer these uploaded files to the server?
  - Something along the lines is expected: I would use `<input type="file">` element, form type `multipart-form` or base64 encoded json or a separate API call for each file with buffer as the payload. Answers like "using some file upload component library in React" would not be wrong either, but would make this question invalid as there would be nothing to check in such case.
 
- What is ArrayBuffer data structure? Or Uint8Array?
  - A data structure representing binary data - an array of bytes, immutable. In this data structure you can store, for example, an image, or a pdf file or whatever. 

(following questions are questionable, probably useless)

- What is canvas? How do you operate on it?
  - Canvas is an element in html from which you can take a drawing context in javascript. Using drawing context, you can imperatively draw lines, shapes, image files.

- What is the purpose of Connection: Keep-Alive header?
  - Expected answer: Connection: Keep-Alive allows you to persist the connection with the server after request ends to reuse it for following requests, which is a significant performance boost especially for high latency requests. Browsers send this header by default.

- What is the difference between POST and GET HTTP methods?
  - Expected answer: GET requests normally don't include the payload body and are cacheable on CDNs

- What is the OPTIONS method preflight request?

- Could you explain what is the purpose of frameworks like React, Vue, Angular?
  - Coding using these frameworks lets you declaratively express the dependency of displayed elements on the data state of the application, so you only need to write code that will render html for a given variable values instead of imperatively updating every component when data it depends on changes.

## CSS questions (6 questions)

- How do you center a div within it's parent?
  - Using either margin:auto or `display:inline-block` + `text-align:center` or `display:flex` + `justify-content:center`.

- If you want to apply different styles when same page is opened on mobile and desktop, what would you normally use?
  - `@media screen max-width` block 

- What are selectors?
  - A syntax to describe a subset of elements on the page to which the styling in the body of the selector will be applied

- What is the difference between margin and padding?

- What are differences between `display:inline-block`, `display:inline` and `display:block`
  - `inline` interprets content as text, allowing it to wrap in the parent component, does not allow margin/padding. `block` interprets content as an unwrappable isolated rectangle rendered as a separate row. `inline-block` also interprets conent as isolated rectangle, but allows it to be _inlined_ between pieces of text or other inline blocks. 

- How to make image fill/fit the container:
  - In `<img>`: object-fit:..., in background: background-size:... 

- How do the animations work in CSS?
  - You define animation keyframes with a unique name and for every keyframe, like 20%, 80% you specify the state of the style attributes of the element. You then reference that keyframes name in a selecter and specify parameters like duration, repetitions count, etc... The animation will play when element enters into the selector coverage.

- What are advantages of using separate stylesheets and styling classes rather than inline styling directly in html? (assuming vanilla context, without tailwind and other modern stuff)
  - Separate stylesheets allow you the separate content from appearance rules which arguably makes code management easier. It also allows you to reuse same styles for more than one element.

- Could you describe some of the filter attribute properties?
  - Greyscale makes element greyscale, hue shifts colors, brightness changes brightness, sepia makes all yellow, drop-shadow makes a nice glow.

## Typescript questions (5 questions)

- What is the difference between any and unknown?
  - Any is a non-type-safe hack, whereas unknown is type safe.

- What are the advantages of strict=true parameter in tsconfig?
  - Without strict=true you lose a lot of type safety: implicit any in functions does not get reported and null checks are not enforced.

- How do you make a class implement an interface in typescript?
  - You can explicitly add "implements IInterfaceName", but that is not mandatory: in typescript any object that has all fields described in the interface will implicitly considered valid implementation of that interface.

- Do types exist at runtime.
  - No. This is one of the official non-goals of the typescript.

- What is the difference between type union and type intersection ("or" and "and" types)?
  - Union broadens the type, allowing it to be either of the elements in the union, whereas intersection narrows the type, limiting allowed values to only those that match every condition of the intersection.


## React questions

- What is state (`useState()`) and what is props?
  - Props are immutable parameters coming from parent component, state are internal mutable variables.

- If you have a computation-heavy function used in the rendering, how to make it reuse cached result between re-renderings instead of getting called again and again? Assuming that this function is expressed through props.
  - `useMemo()`. If answered "`useEffect()`", ask for a stateless alternative.

- What is the second parameter of the `useEffect()`? The array that follows the callback parameter.
  - List of values that trigger that callback every time any of them is changed.

- What is the purpose of `key` attribute?
  - It binds the state of the component to a specific string value: when that value changes between two renders, component is re-created resetting it's internal state.

- (answer appears to be incorrect) When component re-render gets triggered?
  - When any of the props values are changed or internal state is changed.

- If you have an array variable in the state, and you want to add a value to that array, how would you do that and why?
  - `setArr([...arr, newValue])`. `arr.push()` does not trigger re-render in React: object reference has to be changed. 

- What will happen if rendering function of some component on the page, say, a button, throws an exception in default project setup and why?
  - You'll see a blank page because that exception is effectively propagated to the root component's rendering function that effectively never returns. This is different, for example, than in Vue where template content is not part of executable js code.

- How can you manipulate scrollbar state or focus an element in React.
  - Using ref (I wonder if candidate will actually know a better approach...)

- If you want to pass a callback to a child component without making child component re-render every time parent component is re-rendered despite child's props not changing since last re-render, how would you go about it? (passing a callback as `onChange={e => doStuff()}` will always trigger re-render of the child component)
  - By wrapping the callback in `useCallback()`

- What is the difference between React's `onChange=...` attribute and vanilla html's `onchange="..."` attribute?
  - React's `onChange=...` gets triggered on every character input, whereas html's `onchange="..."` is essentially only triggered on blur  

- Can you tell me what is Next.js, how it works and why is it needed?
  - Next.js is a framework that lets you render html from React components on server side by using a principle called "hydration" of synchronizing the initial state of the component rendered on server with reactive state on client when browser javascript overtakes the control over the component. Next.js is needed for Server-Side Rendering to serve the page content as html instead of making user wait till his browser executes js code and produces the html to show on the page. This has benefits for performance, compatibility with low-end devices and, most notably, for making it easier for search engines to crawl your web page without executing javascript.   

Ожидаемые ответы предоставлены чтоб помочь собеседователю понять суть вопроса, однако ответ собеседуемого вполне может оказаться более полным/точным, не списывайте такой случай как ошибку ;)


## Backend questions

- You need to execute two SQL write operations together (say, insert a `comment` record and update the `last_commented_on` column in `person` table). How can you guarantee that if one of the operations fails (say, due to a database restart between the two calls), that the changes made by the other operation will not persist either, i.e. that there will be no inconsistent state in database caused by partial update.
  - By wrapping the operations in a transaction: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction
- What are keys/indexes neded for
  - To speed up queries filtering by indexed columns. Without indexes filtering will work by linear search of the whole table.
- What is Foreign Key
  - A constraint that forces a column representing an ID in another table to be consistent, i.e. to guarantee that it exists in the said table 
- What is LEFT JOIN
  - Join that does not remove base table rows if there are no matches in the joined table 
- How can you create a dead lock
  - With transactions: with pessimistic lock, transaction A lock a row in table X, then a row in table Y; transaction B locks a row in table Y, then in table X
  - Without transactions: lock a table and forget to unlock it
