 Work Experience
----------------

- 2021 - present<br><br/>
    Back to [Blockchain Cuties](http://blockchaincuties.com/) ^_^

- 2020 - 2021<br/><br/>
    Software Developer at [Parsiq](https://parsiq.net/) blockchain events monitoring system<br/>
        
	I was mostly involved in development of the ParsiQL language: helping in designing language syntax and semantics, implementing compiler, runtime engine, etc... I also wrote some code for UX for the in-browser IDE, like code completion.
	
- 2019 - 2020<br/><br/>
    Full Stack developer at [Blockchain Cuties](http://blockchaincuties.com/) gacha-like [dapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) web game.<br/>
	
	This was a short, but an enjoyable experience with really cool teammates and a lot of blockchain-related work. It was one of the first projects in the [Non-Fungible Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) industry. The intent was to give player "true" ownership over the character endorsed by [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract), the characters were "minted" through so-called [genome breeding](https://wiki.blockchaincuties.com/Attributes) and could be transferred outside of the game - traded on independent resources like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/).

	In this project I primarily wrote the server code. I was implementing various mechanisms on backend, like payments, tournaments, game market, crafting, dungeons... I did a lot of optimisation, test coverage and just improved the quality of the code left from previous maintaners. Before I joined, the web site had [PageSpeed Insights score](blockchaincuties.com/login) of **6%** (yes, the web page literally took 20+ seconds to load), today it's **69%** on the login page and up to 97% on individual pages (now pages load within a second from most parts of the world).
	
	One of my tasks was integrating our game with [Samsung Blockchain Keystore](https://developer.samsung.com/blockchain/keystore/understanding-keystore/keystore-introduction.html) Hardware Wallet in [this](https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.wecangames.blockchaincutiesuniverse) android apk for [Tron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRON_(cryptocurrency)) blockchain. This involved quite an amount of research, generating raw blockchain transaction, finding the right hashing algorithm, messing with protobuf - the documentation was scarce, but we made it.
	
	One unique opportunity I had at this job was to talk directly with our app users via public chat - [t.me/blockchaincuties_en](https://t.me/blockchaincuties_en) listening to their feedback and bug reports and reacting right away. You may drop there and ask whether Klesun was a cool dude, I think many will answer "yes" ;)

- 2014 - 2019 (5 years)<br/><br/>
    Backend Developer at [ASAP Tickets](https://www.asaptickets.com/) travel agency.<br/>
    [GDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_distribution_system) integration department.
    
    I created and maintained a node.js application that connected to different distribution systems, like
    [Galileo (United Airlines)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_GDS), 
    [Sabre (American Airlines)](https://www.sabre.com/about/), 
    [Amadeus](http://www.amadeus.com/web/amadeus/ru_1A-corporate/Hotels/Our-portfolio/Connect/Distribute-&-sell-through-more-channels/Hotels_Product_AmadeusGDS/1319572127006-Solution_C-AMAD_ProductDetailPpal-1319578304458?industrySegment=1259068355773&level2=1319608960115&level3=1319610649867), 
    [Hertz](https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/reservation/), 
    [Delpaso](https://www.delpasocarhire.com/), 
    etc... usually via [SOAP XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) protocol and did various fin tech automatizations through these systems.

    The aim of the project was to improve the performance of our sales agents by providing them a set of tools to find the best multi-segment flights and fares in shortest times.

    If you track history of ITN, you could tell that the 2014 was the start a golden age for 
    this company. Before I started developing it, it was just a relatively small travel agency. 
    Now it shows on the first pages in google and has [mostly very positive ratings by customers](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.asaptickets.com).


 Skills
--------
Languages:
- English: technical fluent
- Russian: fluent
- ECMAScript: native
- Latvian: average

Programming:
- I don't consider that programmer is defined by a particular language, an experienced programmer can master any new language syntax and specifics within a week, but just for the sake of numbers:
  - Highly profficient (at least 150k LoC each) in: [typescript](https://github.com/klesun/ts-browser)/[node.js](https://github.com/klesun/kunkka-tor.rent), [Java](https://github.com/klesun/deep-assoc-completion)
  - Actively worked (at least 30k LoC each) with: [C#](https://github.com/klesun/iron-ladybug), [Scala](https://github.com/klesun/deep-js-completion), [Python](https://github.com/klesun/deep-dict-completion), [Lua](https://github.com/klesun/green-envy-xmas-defense), [Rust](https://github.com/klesun/hardsub-ocr-by-font), [PHP](https://asaptickets.com/)
(see "[Personal Projects](#user-content-personal-projects)" below)
- Worked a lot with different SQL databases, messaging queues (RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ) and Redis, had opportunities to experience firsthand the impact of my optimizations on the databases with billions of
records, some of my tweaks resulted in 100x reduction of database load from particular operations and reduced overall server load several times.
- Capable of setting up and maintaining a [Unix sever](https://klesun.net) on either node.js, Nginx or Apache, around 7 years of experience of devopsing personal projects. In later years migrated some of the projects to Google Cloud and AWS through Kubernetes.
- Academically familiar with: C, C++, Pascal
- I'm really good with recursive algorithms. I wrote [this](https://github.com/klesun/Progmeistars_tasks/tree/master/Sem5_PointersRecursions_Vlad/e11) in 2012 and the state of art [this](https://github.com/klesun/deep-assoc-completion/blob/master/src/org/klesun/deep_assoc_completion/resolvers/DirectTypeResolver.java) in 2018. And I only get better ever since.

I take big pride in the quality of the products I develop and I take as a must for a developer to fully comprehend the consequences of every line of code in their application.

I'm a fanatic about efficiency, strict typing and pure functional programming because that's obviously the clean and beautiful way to code.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>

<h3><a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9927-deep-assoc-completion">deep-assoc-completion</a></h3>
An <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij IDEA</a> plugin that adds type inference based completion in PHP code.<br/>

It's basically a semi-[interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) of the php language implemented in Java.

To provide the completion, the plugin analyzes all sources and outcomes of the code you are editing to provide quality contextual completion.

Developing this system involved heavy usage of [lazy computations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html) and [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) due to recursive and duplicative nature of the processed data.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/klesun/ts-browser">ts-browser</a></h3>
	    
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> on-the-fly compilation runtime. It implements import dependency graph resolution, transpiles ts modules to js using [typescriptServices.js](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59874612/2750743) and [web-workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) for parallel processing, caches by checksum and evaluates the code when time comes. A decent solution for hosting a small-scale static typescript web site without the requirement for the build step in the pipeline.

 Education
-----------

- 9+ years of heavy self-education.

------

Most of my skills are programming related. But I also have some valuable experience in Image/Video editing
