I had the pleasure of working together with Tatyana Chugunova during 2019-2023 on the blockchaincuties.com project

Tatyana is a result-oriented person, rational, very responsible and organized which I recon is a really rare trait for her trade.

Her art is beautiful, it was the primary selling point of the project. Though she tends to critize and underestimate her own work a lot.

Tatyana is well technically-versed, to the point that she even mastered the manual coding of animations inside SVG images, which saved devs a lot of work!

She is also a big animal lover, which I think is a good measurement of one's character.

It would be a wise choice to hire her, I guarantee it.
